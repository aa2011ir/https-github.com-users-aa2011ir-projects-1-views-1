--[[
Neurope is unbalanced by design, with almost only unique start positions. The
layouts acknolowedge that and lean into the unbalanced nature of the map, with
no intent whatsover to try and balance start positions themselves.

Instead, we just try to maximize "coverage" of the map by distributing players
on a somewhat even manner as much as possible, akin to the default map start
positions defined by the map authors, except we add randomness onto the base
layouts in order to force scouting (e.g. in some cases there will be nobody in
the sea / islands, a fact which needs to be scouted to be taken advantage of).
