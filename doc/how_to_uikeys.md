How to configure UIKeys
=======================

Disable the BAR Hotkeys widget, press F11 in game and click on the BAR Hotkeys entry, make sure to make it from green to red.

Copy the default uikeys sample from [here](uikeys_default.txt) and paste it in a file called `uikeys.txt` in your BAR root folder.
Use [this file](uikeys_gridmenu.txt) instead if you use gridmenu.

If you don't know what's your BAR root folder you can do either of these:

- Open Launcher, click on 'Open Installation Directory'
- Open game, type `/keysave`, check the directory in which the uikeys.tmp file was created
