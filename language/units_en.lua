They serve as a great support for your attacks and can turn the tide of war easily. However, they have very little armor and quickly vanish if faced with even basic anti-air. Always try to hide them from enemy's radars - surprise is their strength. Useful as a defense of last resort too.",
				corca = "A Construction Aircraft is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander. Moreover it can build some more advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Aircraft Plant. Due to their speed, the highest amongst constructors, it may be used for quick expansions and reclaiming in areas far from your base. It can also access the whole map, as it doesn't care about any natural obstacles. It has a very low HP, so keep away from enemy's anti air units. Due to little build power you may want to use multiple air cons at once. Each Construction Aircraft increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 25.",

Moreover it can build some more advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Bot lab. It is slightly slower and weaker than vehicle constructor, but it can climb stepper hills, so it is effective in expansion on mountainous terrain. Each Construction Bot increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 50. It is wise to use pairs of cons for expansion, so they can heal each other and build defensive structures faster. This makes them immune to light assault units like fleas/jeffys.",

Always send a few with your army to protect it from EMP drones/gunships or commander drop tactics. Remember that it has no land-to-land weapons, so it is not able to defend itself. In bigger numbers it can prevent bombing runs. It is able to walk underwater - combine it with amphibious units!",

Moreover it can build some more advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Vehicle Lab. It is slightly faster and stronger than Bot constructor, but it can not climb stepper hills, so it is effective only in expansion on relatively flat terrain. Each Construction vehicle increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 50. It is wise to use pairs of cons for expansion, so they can heal each other and build defensive structures faster. This makes them immune to light assault units like fleas/jeffys.",

It is the fastest moving unit in the whole game (except ARM counterpart -Jeffy) but due to light armor any close confrontation will be lethal to it. Evade laser towers and destroy metal extractors to slow down your foe's expansion! In T2 warfare Weasels come as an effective counter to slow shooting units, like snipers, penetrators and artillery. When produced constantly and sent to the front they can pull the heavy fire on themselves while your T2 units deal damage to artillery.",
				corfink = "Fink is a cheap and fast-moving air scout, that is not armed with any weapons, but a huge line of sight. It is used to gain intelligence on what your enemy is planning, and where he keeps his most important units. Information is the most valuable asset on the battlefield, knowing your opponent's plans you can prepare your counter strikes early, making his moves inefficient. In lategame a constant stream of scouts helps your artillery units, improving their aim. They can also be used as a cheap distraction swarm that takes the fire from anti-air during bombing runs.",

It is weaker than most land based tanks, so to use it effectively avoid direct fire exchange and try to surprise your opponent by destroying undefended targets near the shoreline.

This makes it useful against fast lightly armored units, such as Peewees. A bit slower than its ARM counterpart - flash, but it has a higher range, so always try to keep distance. Being very cheap to build and having high top speeds can be useful for scouting and taking down unguarded metal extractors and eco. In late T1 warfare Flash can be used in large numbers for ambushing Commanders and speedy skirmishing. Light armor and short range makes it susceptible to defensive towers and riot tanks",

In larger packs Slashers can even take down Heavy Laser Turrets. Combine with Levelers/Raiders and repairing units for a devastating frontline push! Move them in line, because they can't shoot over each other.",
				cormlv = "The Spolier is a stealthy minelayer/minesweeper unit, that can make your base feel really safe. It produces light and heavy mines which are designed to eliminate different levels of threat. Light mines can stop Pewees, A.K., Flashes etc. and heavy can even stop most T2 units. IT's a cheap way to secure places where you don't have time to set up proper defenses, like your flanks. Always lay mines away from your opponent's line of sight and avoid having your own units on the minefield. To create effective minefields use Shift and drag with LMB while ordering a queue. REMEMBER that mines use energy to remain cloaked! Spoilers can also detonate enemy's mines using the attack command.",

Its build menu includes some water based units like underwater metal extractors, tidal generators and most importantly the amphibious complex, a lab that includes T2 amphibious tanks and Bots. As all amphibious units it can easily cross stepper hills unlike regular vehicles. It can be destroyed by torpedoes so avoid submarines, launchers and destroyers.

Click A for attack and drag your RMB to execute a carpet bombing, or use area attack command to strike targets within a circle.",
				corstorm = "Storm is a light rocket Bot used mainly to push the frontline towards opponent's base. It can outrange light laser turrets so if your enemy expands solely with a Commander, Storms can force him to retreat. In bigger numbers and with repairing support of resurrection Bots they are able to take down more advanced defensive structures. Very ineffective against fast mobile units, watch out for A.K./Peewees! To protect them use your Commander/Constructors to build progressing defense. In comparison to their ARM counterpart (Rockos) they are a bit slower, but stonger at the same time",
				corthud = "Thud is a plasma Bot that can deal a sizeable damage with relatively low cost of building. It has a shorter range than rocket Bots, but if you manage to reach them, it can easily eliminate them. It has slightly higher HP than rocket Bots, hence it can be used in big numbers to destroy T1 defensive structures. Combine with resurrection Bots (Necros), for healing and resurrecting fallen units, to quickly push the frontline.

Use it for unexpected unit drops bypassing your enemy's defense line, but don't forget to scout first for any anti air units.

Can be used for transporting nano towers too, which enables you to move your build power where you currently need it.",
